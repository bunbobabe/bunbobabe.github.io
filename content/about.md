# Movie Overview + Reception
Real Women Have Curves is a coming-of-age drama-comedy adapted from the play Real Women Have Curves written by Chicana playwright Josefina López. The film spotlights the young protagonist, Ana García—a Chicana teenager and recent high school graduate living in Eastern Los Angeles, California. Despite earning a spot at a prestigious Beverly Hills high school from her academic prowess, Ana comes from a low-income, working class background and is encouraged by her family, especially her mother, to continue working after high school instead of attending college. Ana begins working at her sister’s dress factory with her mother and several other women, although her desire to pursue her education never abates. What unfolds throughout the movie is a moving yet subversive exploration of Latina youth, body image, sexuality, gender roles, and working class within the dynamics of a first generation Mexican-American family. Throughout this film, Ana becomes a widely beloved symbol for body and sex positivity in addition to an individualist form of resistance in a immigrant Latino household that prioritizes the collectivist family unit, even at the expense of its members. 

The film received much critical acclaim upon its release, winning the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2002 among many other awards. Notably, this movie became one of the first Latina-directed independent films with an almost entirely Latino cast to receive such commercial success and positive reception within Hollywood—whose filmmaking conventions have historically excluded Latinas and women in general with curvy body types. In 2019, it became the first Latina-direct film to be inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.
