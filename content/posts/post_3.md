In this scene, Ana comes to work at Estella’s factory for the first time. Ana begins to admire one of Estella’s dresses, to which her mom remarks “You’ll never fit into that one. It’s a size 7” (00:13:31). Two workers in the factory, Norma and Panchita, enter and are introduced to Ana. Carmen makes a fat-shaming comment to Panchita, which is poorly received. In general, the atmosphere in the factory and between the workers is tense, hostile, and unfriendly. As they begin to work, Estella explains that they gets paid $18 for each dress they assemble, although Norma explains that the dresses are then sold at Bloomingdale’s for $600, which provokes outrage in Ana (00:17:20).  

Later on, the workers begin to exchange *chismes*, or gossip, with each other. In an act of “spilling tea,” Carmen shares that Dorado Ortiz, a local man, is in love with Rosalí, one of the employees at the factory. Carmen in this regard says, “he would love to fatten you up, but don’t get as fat as Ana” (00:18:23). Fed up with these comments, Ana runs out of the factory, and her mom chases her. Carmen cannot chase her for long, for she collapses with exhaustion. She bemoans to Ana that she’s too tired to do the factory work nowadays: her hands are arthritic and she’s losing her eyesight. Speaking to her in Spanish, Carmen says to Ana [translated]: “Are you ashamed to work with us? So much hard work. So much sacrifice. And all for what? For you two. You just think I’m a dog that’s only good for working” (00:20:16).

This scene importantly comments on the economic exploitation of Latino immigrant workers, whose vulnerabilities lead them to take jobs in industries known for poor wages and working conditions. The textile industry is a prime example. Indeed, the atmosphere in Estela’s factory is highly reminiscent of the *maquilas* of Mexico. The shocking disparity between the production and commercial value of Estela’s dresses further cements the idea that society considers Latino labor to be low-skill and cheap despite the fact that this labor is ultimately indispensable to corporate profitability and success. Limited class and financial mobility is a pervasive border, yet Ana shows resistance to the normalization of the devaluation of Latin labor in this scene and throughout the film. Scholar Juanita Heredia corroborates by writing: 

> By situating the women’s labor force at Estela’s factory in the film, Cardoso critiques Latina women’s working conditions in the garment industry in relationship to globalization. Ana, at first considered an outsider, becomes aware of the economic inequalities that exist between the Latina seamstresses working for her sister Estela in the factory and the corporate world represented by Bloomingdale’s, which reflects a social and economic hierarchy within metropolitan Los Angeles (11). 

Dually, this scene also showcases the divide between the first generation immigrant culture and second generation immigrant experience with Ana and Carmen’s exchange on the street. Carmen expresses her grievances at how much she works and dedicates to a family that looks down on the type of labor she does. Again, Carmen exemplifies the values of hard work, family-centrism, and sacrifice expected of older immigrant generations.
