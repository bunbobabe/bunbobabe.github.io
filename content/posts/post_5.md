Because Estella has lost four seamstresses and is behind on dress production, she is struggling to pay the electricity and rent bills for the factory. Estella is shown emailing Mrs. Glass, the owner of the manufacturing company that buys Estella’s dresses and sells them at Bloomingdale’s, to ask for an advance on the payment for the dresses. Ana is bewildered, asking why Estella is emailing her instead of going to see Mrs. Glass in person. Estella responds timidly, saying Mrs. Glass is too busy to see her. Ana infers that Estella is scared of her, but in the following scene, Ana has convinced Estella to go with her to the corporate office to talk to Mrs. Glass. They catch her in the hallway, and Estella asks about the advance payment. Mrs. Glass responds in a cold manner: “Estella, you know the rules. I can’t pay advances. I went out on a limb to hire you in the first place because I believe a woman like me should help a woman like you. But I can only help you so much. You have to help yourself and meet your deadlines…You have until the end of the month” (42:00).

Surprised by Mrs. Glass’ apathy, Ana speaks to her sister in Spanish, saying [translated] “She’s worse than you said.” Mrs. Glass turns around and immediately retorts, saying in unaccented Spanish [translated]:  “Did you say something, Estella?” From this, viewers can infer that Mrs. Glass is likely also Latina.
