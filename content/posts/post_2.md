In this scene, Ana comes to work at Estella’s factory for the first time. Ana begins to admire one of Estella’s dresses, to which her mom remarks “You’ll never fit into that one. It’s a size 7” (00:13:31). Two workers in the factory, Norma and Panchita, enter and are introduced to Ana. Carmen makes a fat-shaming comment to Panchita, which is poorly received. In general, the atmosphere in the factory and between the workers is tense, hostile, and unfriendly. As they begin to work, Estella explains that the factory gets paid $18 for each dress they assemble, although Norma explains that the dresses are then sold at Bloomingdale’s for $600, which provokes outrage in Ana (00:17:20).

Later on, the workers begin to exchange chismes, or gossip, with each other. In an act of “spilling tea,” Carmen shares that Dorado Ortiz, a local man, is in love with Rosalí, one of the employees at the factory. Carmen in this regard says, “he would love to fatten you up, but don’t get as fat as Ana” (00:18:23). Fed up with these comments, Ana runs out of the factory, and her mom chases her. Carmen cannot chase her for long, for she collapses with exhaustion. She bemoans to Ana that she’s too tired to do the factory work nowadays: her hands are arthritic and she’s losing her eyesight. Speaking to her in Spanish, Carmen says to Ana [translated]: “Are you ashamed to work with us? So much hard work. So much sacrifice. And all for what? For you two. You just think I’m a dog that’s only good for working” (00:20:16).
