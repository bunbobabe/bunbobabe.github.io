Here, Ana and Carmen are in a restaurant after finishing at the doctor’s office. Throughout the movie, Carmen had insisted to Ana that she was pregnant although Ana never took her seriously. At the doctor’s, he confirms that Carmen is not pregnant but is undergoing “*el cambio de vida*,” or menopause, to her incredulity and disbelief. At the restaurant white eating a flan, Carmen has finally wrapped her head around it, saying “I’m no longer a woman…A grandmother is what I should be at this age” (1:07:18). As Carmen questions her own womanhood, she begins to scrutinize Ana’s, telling her she should lose weight so she can be more desirable for a man.  Ana sharply fires back: “You’re overweight too. So why should I listen to you?”(1:08:30). Ana begins to pull the plate of flan toward her, as her mom yells at her to not eat the flan. Ana then takes a big bite, cementing her resistance to her mother’s outdated and oppressive notions of womanhood and the female body.

This scene revisits the scrutiny of the female body within Latino communities and again highlights the notion that many believe keeping a slim figure is important to increase marriage prospects. It also highlights the hypocrisy and self-hatred within many Latina women, since Carmen shames bigger bodies despite being overweight herself. This again speaks to the idea that the traditional Latina woman must define herself relative to men and the male gaze, which, at the time that the movie was made, idolized skinniness as the beauty standard. 

Interestingly, researchers became inspired by the discourse generated by this film and researched how Latina girls are affected by beauty standards and perceive beauty within themselves and their communities. In their study, the researchers interviewed  27 Latina mid-adolescent girls (ages 14 to 16) regarding their perceptions of what body shapes and sizes are valued in Latino culture and European American culture. They came to the conclusion that “there was an overwhelming consensus that a slender but curvy figure is the ideal body type in Latino culture and that European Americans value unnaturally thin physiques. Themes drawn from the adolescents’ responses point to their friends’ opinions, perceptions of boys’ dating preferences, norms in their communities, and body shapes of female celebrities in Latino media outlets as sources of beauty and desirability” (111). This importantly demonstrates that Latino media also plays a role on how young women form their thoughts surrounding body image expectations. In spotlighting curvy women with body image struggles, hopefully the film helps to destigmatize bigger bodies within the Latino community at-large.
