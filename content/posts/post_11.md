In this final scene, Ana is preparing to go to the airport to head to New York City. She has already received support for her decision from the whole family besides her mom. Ana speaks to her mom through her locked door, asking her to please come outside and give her blessing to Ana. Carmen is shown deliberating in her room, pacing back and forth and looking at Ana’s photo dejectedly. Ana has to leave for the airport without saying goodbye; she goes with her dad and grandfather. Subversively, we see the men of the family seeing Ana off and supporting her dreams. The grandfather, who had continuously supported Ana throughout the movie, tells Ana not to worry about him and that he will always have her in his heart. The movie ends with Ana on the streets of New York City, awkwardly attempting to “walk like a lady” like her mother would always tell her to do.

In this heart-warming conclusion to a wonderful and moving story, the audience is left with a bittersweet feeling. While many of us were rooting for Ana to go to college, many of us also wanted to see Ana rebuild her relationship with her mom and get Carmen to recognize how she mistreated Ana. Instead, we see nothing of the latter in these last scenes. While this may be upsetting to many, it is nonetheless a realistic portrayal of a mother's resistance to change even at the expense of her daughter’s happiness and wellbeing. Throughout the posts, I’ve explored many features of Latino families and cultures that are spotlighted in this movie: collectivism, family-centrism, gender roles, financial sacrifice, and religion. Many of these features act to the detriment of female autonomy and persist across multiple generations, making it even harder to dismantle traditional notions of femininity and the ‘ideal Latina woman.’ Indeed, “it is not Ana turning her back on the women in the film but rather her mother refusing to accept her daughter’s individuality. The approval by every other character of Ana’s plans, then, is a narrative device that exposes the senselessness of Carmen’s cleaving to outdated traditions, and it is this insistence that creates the divisions in the family” (Leen 10). In the final scene, Ana tries to talk the way her mom would nag her to, coming off as an attempt to reconnect with her mother despite leaving things off on tense terms. By the end of the movie, the audience knows that this isn’t a story with a clear victim and villain but rather a character study of two strong-willed Chicana women attempting to navigate spaces that aren’t made for them.
