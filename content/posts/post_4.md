In this scene, Carmen is shown initiating chismes with the other factory workers about Norma. It was revealed in a previous scene that Norma had to leave the factory because she was moving back to Mexico to get married. Her two sisters and mother—who also worked in the factory—were moving back to Mexico with her, causing Estella to lose four seamstresses and dress production to greatly slow.  While gossiping, Carmen says that Norma’s fiancé convinced her to have sex with him the night before the wedding, and the following day, the fiancé never showed up to the ceremony. Carmen shames Norma, to which Ana engages in the conversion and they have the following exchange (00:39:28-00:39:57):

> **Ana**: Mom, you’re so old fashioned.\
> **Mom**: Girls nowadays think they know so much. That’s why they end up panzona.\
> **Ana**: No mom. The reason they end up pregnant is because they don’t know how to use contraceptives.\
> **Mom**: Your husband is not going to like you knowing so much…A man wants a virgin.\
> **Ana**: Why is a woman’s virginity the only thing that matters? A woman has thoughts, ideas, a mind of her own.
