In this scene, the women of Estela’s factory are close to completing a big dress order. Exasperated by the hot and suffocating conditions of the factory, Ana takes her shirt off to cool down. Carmen immediately disparages her appearance, telling her she looks awful. Estela, Pancha, and Rosalí come to Ana’s defense, telling her she looks beautiful. Each woman begins to talk about her own insecurities, such as her cellulite, stretch marks, and fat and in doing so, starts to strip off her clothes to show the others. They jokingly compare their bodies to orcas and elephants and in these self-deprecating comments, they find solidarity in their shared body types and weights. Carmen scorns all of them, to which Ana responds: “Make myself attractive so I can catch a man?…I do want to  lose weight, but part of me doesn’t because my weight says to everybody FUCK you…how dare anybody tell what I should look like or what I should be. There’s so much more to me than just my weight…This is who we are mama. Real women” (01:13:08).

This scene could almost be interpreted as the climax of the movie, where the audience finally sees the characters talk about their curvy body types in positive ways. Heredia writes: “Like Ana, Cardoso demonstrates in this scene the Latina’s “declaration of independence,” through pride in her body in a city context and one who prefers to follow her own dictates in defining beauty and aesthetics on her own terms as real women should” (12). Although the women are not saying overtly loving things about their bodies and features, their acceptance of their curviness, which is so heavily demonized by Carmen and societal beauty standards alike, acts as a form of resistance. Ironically, a hot sweatshop—which earlier in the movie represented financial exploitation and repression of the Latino workforce—now acts as a space of liberation and reclaiming one’s womanhood. Additionally, in choosing not to join the women, Carmen remains trapped in her own bitterness and insecurities, showing that long-standing patriarchal forms of thinking take time to dismantle.
