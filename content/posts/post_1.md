In this scene, Ana comes back from her last day of high school to see that her family has thrown her a surprise graduation party. Ana’s dad offers her some cake, to which Ana’s mother, Carmen, replies, “can’t you see she’s bigger than the cake?” in Spanish (00:007:28). This is the first of a slew of body-shaming remarks that the mom makes against Ana’s weight and body shape. The parents then ask Ana why she quit her job at a fast food restaurant, which viewers saw in a previous scene, and the mom says Ana will come to work in her sister, Estella’s, dress-making factory. As her mom ropes her into a new job, Mr. Guzman, Ana’s high school English teacher, arrives at the graduation party. He implores Ana’s parents to consider sending Ana to college and explains there are scholarship options for her. The parents respond indignantly, explaining that they have thought about Ana’s college education but need Ana to work. Mr. Guzman leaves the party, and Ana is shown with a forlorn but accepting look on her face.

Later in the evening, Ana’s mom and dad are shown discussing her college education privately in their bedroom. The dad is shown displaying open-mindedness to the idea of Ana going to college whereas Ana’s mom is obstinately against the idea. Carmen goes on a brief spiel in Spanish, saying [translated] “I can educate her. I can teach her to sew. I can teach her to raise her kids. Tend to her husband. They’re not going to teach her those things in college…It’s a question of principles. It’s just not fair. I’ve worked since I was 13 years old. Ana is 18 years old. It’s her turn now” (00:10:15-00:10:31).
