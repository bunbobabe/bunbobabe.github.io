In this scene, Carmen is shown hanging up a San Antonio statue for Ana. She reveals she also hung one up for Estela 11 years ago when she first turned 18. The statues are importantly shown hanging upside down. This brief snippet showcases the influences of Catholicism in Latin American culture and folklore. Saint Anthony of Padua is known as a miracle worker who helps people find things they’ve lost. When hung upside down, he is invoked to quell issues with love and romance and help people leave singlehood. In hanging these up, Carmen shows she is hoping her daughters get married soon. Despite both daughters still being quite young, Carmen’s preoccupation with their marital status speaks again to the prevalence of gender roles and expectations for women in Latino households. In these conservative traditions, marriage is considered the most important path for a woman, and therefore their value is inherently linked to how eligible they are for marriage—which draws on shallow notions of beauty and desirability.
