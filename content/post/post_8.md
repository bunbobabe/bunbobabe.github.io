In this scene, Ana goes to the pharmacy to pick up a cigar for her grandfather and also decides to buy condoms for the first time. She later goes over to Jimmy’s house when his parents aren’t over, and she initiates sex with Jimmy—her first time. Before they begin, Ana asks him to turn on the lights, saying “I want you to see me,” drawing his attention to her naked body which has been the subject of ridicule from her mother throughout the movie (01:04:14). Jimmy responds with “que bonita” in Spanish. After they’ve had sex and Ana is getting ready to leave, she says Jimmy doesn’t have to write to her when they start college or worry about her anymore, saying “you’ll probably end up meeting some skinny girl, right?” (01:05:13).

The next day, Carmen catches Ana admiring her naked body in the mirror. Carmen immediately begins to yell at Ana, inferring that she has lost her virginity. She calls her a tramp and says “you’re not only fat, you’re a puta!” (1:06:31). Ana retorts by saying “there’s more to me than what’s in between my legs” to which Carmen then slaps her in the face. 

A lot can be unpacked from these scenes. At first, Ana’s friendly and positive interaction with the pharmacy clerk helps to destigmatize the action of buying condoms and engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage. Heredia continues with an interpretation of the scene that I believe is spot-on:

> Cardoso purposefully emphasizes Ana’s body as that of a woman of color with curves. Instead of encouraging her daughter, Ana’s mother is disappointed because she is overweight and thus, not as eligible for marriage in her mother’s view. The spectator witnesses a double marginalization. By taking Jimmy as a “secret” boyfriend and lover, Ana declares her own sexual revolution and liberation in that she is following her own mind and desires by refusing to be a virgin until marriage, thereby contesting cultural expectations (9). 

Further, Ana’s intimacy with Jimmy began as consensual, empowering, and body positive only for her to revert to her insecurities when she accuses Jimmy of likely abandoning her for a skinny girl once they go to college. Guerrero has an interesting take on what may be transpiring in Ana’s mind during this scene: 

> Carmen’s  opinions  serve  to reflect the always present tension in blending her first generation immigrant culture with that of American society and expectations of her daughter’s second generation immigrant experience. Thus, some may see Ana’s first sexual experiences as a reflection of a confused culture. However, others may see that Ana’s decision to become sexually active is a symbol of reclaiming her own power (90).
