-   Why does Ana’s mother, Carmen, not think Ana needs to go to college, despite her teacher Mr. Guzman insisting that she is very gifted and bright?
-   What is the importance of the chismes or gossip that the women at Estella’s factory engage in? Do you think it is helpful, harmful, or a bit of both?
-   Carmen is constantly shown making body-shaming comments about Ana’s appearance throughout the movie. How does this influence how Ana perceives herself and beauty in general?
-   What does the San Antonio statue mean to Doña Carmen? Why does she hang them up when her daughters turn 18?
-   Were you surprised when Mrs. Glass spoke Spanish to Estella and Ana? What does that scene say about socioeconomic and class privilege within the Latino community?
-   In your opinion, are Ana and Jimmy a good match?
-   Why do you think that Carmen insists that she is pregnant and won’t accept anything otherwise?
-   Did you expect the mom to not give Ana her blessing to move to New York? Why or why not?
-   What did you make of the final scene of Ana in New York City?
-   By the end of the film, several things are left unclear. Will Estella ever get her own dress line? Will Ana and her mom reconcile? Will Jimmy and Ana continue to talk as they start college? Why do you think things were left unclear? Do you think anything in the movie points to a certain outcome for any of these points of tension?
