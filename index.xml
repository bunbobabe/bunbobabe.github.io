      <description>Why does Ana’s mother, Carmen, not think Ana needs to go to college, despite her teacher Mr. Guzman insisting that she is very gifted and bright? What is the importance of the chismes or gossip that the women at Estella’s factory engage in? Do you think it is helpful, harmful, or a bit of both? Carmen is constantly shown making body-shaming comments about Ana’s appearance throughout the movie. How does this influence how Ana perceives herself and beauty in general?</description>

      <description>In this scene, Ana comes back from her last day of high school to see that her family has thrown her a surprise graduation party. Ana’s dad offers her some cake, to which Ana’s mother, Carmen, replies, “can’t you see she’s bigger than the cake?” in Spanish (00:007:28). This is the first of a slew of body-shaming remarks that the mom makes against Ana’s weight and body shape. The parents then ask Ana why she quit her job at a fast food restaurant, which viewers saw in a previous scene, and the mom says Ana will come to work in her sister, Estella’s, dress-making factory.</description>
