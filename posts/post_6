In this scene, Mr. Guzman comes to Ana’s house to tell her she has gotten into Columbia with a full scholarship. Ana is elated, but her parents are dismayed when they find out Columbia is in New York City, all the way across the country. Mr. Guzman does his best to convince the parents to let her go, saying “you left your country for a better opportunity. And now it’s Ana’s turn.” The dad responds with: “Ana is going to go to college, but not now. I didn’t come this far to see my family break apart.” The mom further tries to guilt Ana for wanting to leave for college. She behooves her by saying “What about Estella and the factory? What about abuelo? You want to abandon him?” Due to the lack of support from both of her parents, Ana accepts that she will not be going to Columbia, and Mr. Guzman leaves.
