Estela is shown emailing Mrs. Glass, the owner of the manufacturing company that buys Estella’s dresses and sells them at Bloomingdale’s, to ask for an advance on the payment for the dresses. Ana is bewildered, asking why Estela is emailing her instead of going to see Mrs. Glass in person. Estela responds timidly, saying Mrs. Glass is too busy to see her. Ana infers that Estela is scared of her, but in the following scene, Ana has convinced Estela to go with her to the corporate office to talk to Mrs. Glass. They catch her in the hallway, and Estela asks about the advance payment. Mrs. Glass responds in a cold manner: “Estela, you know the rules. I can’t pay advances. I went out on a limb to hire you in the first place because I believe a woman like me should help a woman like you. But I can only help you so much. You have to help yourself and meet your deadlines…You have until the end of the month” (42:00).\nSurprised by Mrs. Glass’ apathy, Ana speaks to her sister in Spanish, saying [translated], “she’s worse than you said.” Mrs. Glass turns around and immediately retorts, saying in unaccented Spanish [translated]: “Did you say something, Estella?” From this, we can infer that Mrs. Glass is likely also Latina.\nAnalogous to Ana’s antagonistic relationship with Carmen, we see Mrs. Glass’ severity and callousness toward Estela despite both of them being working Latinas. I believe this scene serves to comment on the existence of class privileges and divides within the Latino community itself. The case of Mrs. Glass shows that when some Latinos are able to overcome the borders hindering their economic mobility and find, in relative terms, “success,” they can still manage to look down upon and perpetuate the subjugation of other Latinos. Mrs. Glass makes no exceptions for Estela, saying “you have to help yourself”—which echoes the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” sentiment often thrown around in contemporary discourse surrounding immigrant labor. Mrs. Glass’ words also gleam with condescension and self-gratification from the idea that she has already given Estela several handouts. While brief, this scene importantly highlighted the systemic factors that constrict working class Latinos in addition to the dichotomy within the Latino community surrounding class, success, and stereotypes.\n","wordCount":"408","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bella Hubble"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://bunbobabe.github.io/posts/post_6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bella's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://bunbobabe.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://bunbobabe.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/about/ title="About the Movie"><span>About the Movie</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/guiding/ title="Guiding Questions"><span>Guiding Questions</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/references/ title=References><span>References</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Meeting Latina Girlboss (?)
