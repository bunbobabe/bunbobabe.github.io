Carmen immediately begins to yell at Ana, inferring that she has lost her virginity. She calls her a tramp and says “you’re not only fat, you’re a puta!” (1:06:31).

Instead of encouraging her daughter, Ana’s mother is disappointed because she is overweight and thus, not as eligible for marriage in her mother’s view. The spectator witnesses a double marginalization. By taking Jimmy as a “secret” boyfriend and lover, Ana declares her own sexual revolution and liberation in that she is following her own mind and desires by refusing to be a virgin until marriage, thereby contesting cultural expectations (9).\nFurther, Ana’s intimacy with Jimmy began as consensual, empowering, and body positive only for her to revert to her insecurities when she accuses Jimmy of likely abandoning her for a skinny girl once they go to college. Guerrero has an interesting take on what may be transpiring in Ana’s mind during this scene:\nCarmen’s opinions serve to reflect the always present tension in blending her first generation immigrant culture with that of American society and expectations of her daughter’s second generation immigrant experience. Thus, some may see Ana’s first sexual experiences as a reflection of a confused culture. However, others may see that Ana’s decision to become sexually active is a symbol of reclaiming her own power (90).\n","wordCount":"447","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bella Hubble"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://bunbobabe.github.io/posts/post_8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bella's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://bunbobabe.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://bunbobabe.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/about/ title="About the Movie"><span>About the Movie</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/guiding/ title="Guiding Questions"><span>Guiding Questions</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/references/ title=References><span>References</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Scene 8: Cigars and Condoms</h1><div class=post-meta>3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Bella Hubble</div></header><div class=post-content><p><img loading=lazy src=/imgs/scene8_1.png alt="Example image"></p><p>In this scene, Ana goes to the pharmacy to pick up a cigar for her grandfather and also decides to buy condoms for the first time.
