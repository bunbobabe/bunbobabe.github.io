Ana is elated, but her parents are dismayed when they find out Columbia is in New York City, all the way across the country. Mr. Guzman does his best to convince the parents to let her go, saying “you left your country for a better opportunity. And now it’s Ana’s turn.” The dad responds with: “Ana is going to go to college, but not now. I didn’t come this far to see my family break apart.” The mom further tries to guilt Ana for wanting to leave for college. She behooves her by saying “What about Estella and the factory? What about abuelo? You want to abandon him?” Due to the lack of support from both of her parents, Ana accepts that she will not be going to Columbia, and Mr. Guzman leaves.\nThis scene revisits the idea of the nuclear/collectivist Latino family unit that carves out set pathways for its youngest members to follow. Ana’s divergence from such a path, which involves staying close to home to support her family, is interpreted as not just abandoning her family but her culture and values. The viewer may be feeling frustrated at this point by the fact that Ana’s parents have not really provided concrete reasons as to why she can’t attend college. Shouldn’t the prestige of Columbia and the full financial scholarship eliminate almost all barriers? In addition to temporarily fracturing the family dynamic, Ana’s parents may not consider college to be worth it in terms of financial mobility. Scholar Jeanne Guerrero posts that “facing limited employment opportunities, many immigrants view self-employment as a route to upward mobility…In the eyes of Ana’s mother, a college education is not the top priority and working in the factory to help her sister is of utmost importance; therefore, she feels it should also be of utmost importance to Ana” (89).\n","wordCount":"328","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bella Hubble"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://bunbobabe.github.io/posts/post_7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bella's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://bunbobabe.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://bunbobabe.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/about/ title="About the Movie"><span>About the Movie</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/guiding/ title="Guiding Questions"><span>Guiding Questions</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/references/ title=References><span>References</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Ana gets into Columbia</h1><div class=post-meta>2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Bella Hubble</div></header><div class=post-content><p>In this scene, Mr. Guzman comes to Ana’s house to tell her she has gotten into Columbia with a full scholarship.
