Ana’s dad offers her some cake, to which Ana’s mother, Carmen, replies [translated], “can’t you see she’s bigger than the cake?” in Spanish (00:007:28). This is the first of a slew of body-shaming remarks that the mom makes against Ana’s weight and body shape. The parents then ask Ana why she quit her job at a fast food restaurant, which viewers saw in a previous scene, and the mom says Ana will come to work in her sister, Estella’s, dress-making factory. As her mom ropes her into a new job, Mr. Guzman, Ana’s high school English teacher, arrives at the graduation party. He implores Ana’s parents to consider sending Ana to college and explains there are scholarship options for her. The parents respond indignantly, explaining that they have thought about Ana’s college education but need Ana to work. Mr. Guzman leaves the party, and Ana is shown with a forlorn but accepting look on her face.\nThis expository scene lays the groundwork for many of the film’s recurring themes and topics—such as Ana getting body shamed by Carmen and Ana’s parents questioning the role of higher education in her life. A central point of tension within the movie is the generational and cultural discrepancy between first and second generation immigrants, with Ana representing a contemporary and progressive Chicana whereas Carmen represents an immigrant Chicana still grounded in tradition. Ana’s parents don’t want her to pursue higher education because they view it as contradictory to the collectivist family unit that is at the heart of many Latin American cultures. Indeed, “Latin American cultures with a collectivistic orientation emphasize the goals and interests of the group over those of individual members. A critical aspect of a collectivistic ideology is a strong concern for the fate and well-being of one’s kin, and family members within collectivistic cultures often are expected to support each other and assist in the maintenance of the household” (Guerrero 86). This explains why Carmen is so insistent that Ana stay and help with Estela’s business. Although Ana remains placid in this scene, she has not given up on her hopes of going to college. As viewers will see throughout the rest of the movie, Ana’s individualist attitude toward higher education will continue to embolden the rift between her and her mom in addition to challenging the notion of collectivism within the Latino family.\n","wordCount":"419","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bella Hubble"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://bunbobabe.github.io/posts/post_1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bella's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://bunbobabe.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://bunbobabe.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/about/ title="About the Movie"><span>About the Movie</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/guiding/ title="Guiding Questions"><span>Guiding Questions</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/references/ title=References><span>References</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://bunbobabe.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Can’t you see she’s bigger than the cake?</h1><div class=post-meta>2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Bella Hubble</div></header><div class=post-content><p>In this scene, Ana comes back from her last day of high school to see that her family has thrown her a surprise graduation party.
