The film spotlights the young protagonist, Ana García—a Chicana teenager and recent high school graduate living in Eastern Los Angeles, California. Despite earning a spot at a prestigious Beverly Hills high school from her academic prowess, Ana comes from a low-income, working class background and is encouraged by her family, especially her mother, to continue working after high school instead of attending college. Ana begins working at her sister’s dress factory with her mother and several other women, although her desire to pursue her education never abates. What unfolds throughout the movie is a moving yet subversive exploration of Latina youth, body image, sexuality, gender roles, and working class within the dynamics of a first generation Mexican-American family. Throughout this film, Ana becomes a widely beloved symbol for body and sex positivity in addition to an individualist form of resistance in a immigrant Latino household that prioritizes the collectivist family unit, even at the expense of its members.</p><p>The film received much critical acclaim upon its release, winning the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2002 among many other awards. Notably, this movie became one of the first Latina-directed independent films with an almost entirely Latino cast to receive such commercial success and positive reception within Hollywood—whose filmmaking conventions have historically excluded Latinas and women in general with curvy body types. In 2019, it became the first Latina-directed film to be inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.</p><h1 id=character-list>Character List</h1><ul><li><strong>Ana García</strong> (played by America Ferrera) - the protagonist of the movie, an 18 year-old Chicana woman who has just graduated high school and is torn between getting her college education and helping her sister with her dress factory</li><li><strong>Estella García</strong> (played in Ingrid Oliu) - Ana’s sister, owns a dress factory that supplies Bloomingdale’s</li><li><strong>Carmen García</strong> (played by Lupe Ontiveros) - Ana’s mom, works in Estella’s factory, is very critical of both her daughters, but Ana in particular</li><li><strong>Raul García</strong> (played by Jorge Cervera, Jr.) - Ana’s dad, works as a landscaper, is initially skeptical of Ana going to college but later gives her his blessing to do so</li><li><strong>Abuelo</strong> (played by Felipe de Alba) - Ana’s grandfather, tells her stories about his village in Mexico</li><li><strong>Mr. Guzman</strong> (played by George Lopez) - Ana’s high school English teacher, encourages her to apply to college and believe in herself</li><li><strong>Jimmy</strong> (played by Brian Sites) - Ana’s love interest, went to the same high school as her, is planning to study to become a teacher in college</li><li><strong>Norma</strong> (played by Lina Acosta) - worked in Estella’s factory, left the factory to move back to Mexico and get married</li><li><strong>Rosalí</strong> (played by Lourdes Pérez) - works in Estella’s factory</li><li><strong>Pancha</strong> (played by Soledad St. Hilaire) - works in Estella’s factory</li><li><strong>Mrs. Glass</strong> (played by Marlene Forte) - owner of the manufacturing company that buys Estella’s dresses and supplies them to Bloomingdale’s</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class=footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-12><div class=footer-inner><h3 class=footer-title>Hugo Serif Theme</h3><div id=footer-menu class=footer-menu><ul><li class=menu-item-home><a href=/><span>Home</span></a></li><li class=menu-item-contact><a href=/contact/><span>Contact</span></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=sub-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-12><div class=sub-footer-inner><div class=copyright>Free Hugo theme by <a class=zerostatic href=https://www.zerostatic.io>www.zerostatic.io</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/js/scripts.min.8504133605a277da18f0d58cfd2e90d154962f4a961543a6e2f0a459a2d05462.js></script></body></html>
