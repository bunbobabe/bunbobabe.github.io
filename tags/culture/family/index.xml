Ana’s dad offers her some cake, to which Ana’s mother, Carmen, replies [translated], “can’t you see she’s bigger than the cake?” in Spanish (00:007:28). This is the first of a slew of body-shaming remarks that the mom makes against Ana’s weight and body shape. The parents then ask Ana why she quit her job at a fast food restaurant, which viewers saw in a previous scene, and the mom says Ana will come to work in her sister, Estella’s, dress-making factory. As her mom ropes her into a new job, Mr. Guzman, Ana’s high school English teacher, arrives at the graduation party. He implores Ana’s parents to consider sending Ana to college and explains there are scholarship options for her. The parents respond indignantly, explaining that they have thought about Ana’s college education but need Ana to work. Mr. Guzman leaves the party, and Ana is shown with a forlorn but accepting look on her face.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This expository scene lays the groundwork for many of the film&amp;rsquo;s recurring themes and topics—such as Ana getting body shamed by Carmen and Ana’s parents questioning the role of higher education in her life. A central point of tension within the movie is the generational and cultural discrepancy between first and second generation immigrants, with Ana representing a contemporary and progressive Chicana whereas Carmen represents an immigrant Chicana still grounded in tradition. Ana’s parents don’t want her to pursue higher education because they view it as contradictory to the collectivist family unit that is at the heart of many Latin American cultures. Indeed, “Latin American cultures with a collectivistic orientation emphasize the goals and interests of the group over those of individual members. A critical aspect of a collectivistic ideology is a strong concern for the fate and well-being of one’s kin, and family members within collectivistic cultures often are expected to support each other and assist in the maintenance of the household” (Guerrero 86). This explains why Carmen is so insistent that Ana stay and help with Estela’s business. Although Ana remains placid in this scene, she has not given up on her hopes of going to college. As viewers will see throughout the rest of the movie, Ana’s individualist attitude toward higher education will continue to embolden the rift between her and her mom in addition to challenging the notion of collectivism within the Latino family.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ahora le toca a ella</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Later in the evening after the graduation party, Ana’s mom and dad are shown discussing her college education privately in their bedroom. The dad is shown displaying open-mindedness to the idea of Ana going to college whereas Ana’s mom is obstinately against the idea. Carmen goes on a brief spiel in Spanish, saying [translated] “I can educate her. I can teach her to sew. I can teach her to raise her kids. Tend to her husband. They’re not going to teach her those things in college…It’s a question of principles. It’s just not fair. I’ve worked since I was 13 years old. Ana is 18 years old. It’s her turn now” (00:10:15-00:10:31).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene1_2.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scene is essential to understanding the gender roles and gendered expectations present within this particular Mexican-American family and within Latino families at-large. Sadly enough, women are often agents of patriarchy within Latino households. As Scholar Catherine Leen writes: “Carmen’s sole opposition to Ana’s plans underlines the fact that…the family matriarch can be more machista than any patriarch” (5). Additionally, when Carmen says “it’s just not fair,” the scene insinuates that Carmen is harboring resentment and jealousy toward Ana since she is being given opportunities she never had the opportunity of pursuing. When Carmen was growing up in Mexico, she likely did not have supportive male figures like Mr. Guzman who encouraged her to obtain an education. Although it’s wrong for her to control Ana’s life, Carmen’s acceptance and perpetuation of gender roles are reflections of patriarchal ideas and systems that are endemic to Latin America and serve to oppress women across generations. For these reasons, Carmen’s resentment toward Ana may also explain why she is always body shaming her. As one movie reviewer writes: “Part of [Carmen’s] impatience with Ana comes from a sense of competition, an element that Ms. Cardoso and the writers, Josefina Lopez and George LaVoo, don&amp;rsquo;t make overly explicit” (Mitchell).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ana gets into Columbia</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_7/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this scene, Mr. Guzman comes to Ana’s house to tell her she has gotten into Columbia with a full scholarship. Ana is elated, but her parents are dismayed when they find out Columbia is in New York City, all the way across the country. Mr. Guzman does his best to convince the parents to let her go, saying “you left your country for a better opportunity. And now it’s Ana’s turn.” The dad responds with: “Ana is going to go to college, but not now. I didn’t come this far to see my family break apart.” The mom further tries to guilt Ana for wanting to leave for college. She behooves her by saying “What about Estella and the factory? What about &lt;em>abuelo&lt;/em>? You want to abandon him?” Due to the lack of support from both of her parents, Ana accepts that she will not be going to Columbia, and Mr. Guzman leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene6.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scene revisits the idea of the nuclear/collectivist Latino family unit that carves out set pathways for its youngest members to follow. Ana’s divergence from such a path, which involves staying close to home to support her family, is interpreted as not just abandoning her family but her culture and values. The viewer may be feeling frustrated at this point by the fact that Ana’s parents have not really provided concrete reasons as to why she can’t attend college. Shouldn’t the prestige of Columbia and the full financial scholarship eliminate almost all barriers? In addition to temporarily fracturing the family dynamic, Ana’s parents may not consider college to be worth it in terms of financial mobility. Scholar Jeanne Guerrero posts that “facing limited employment opportunities, many immigrants view self-employment as a route to upward mobility…In the eyes of Ana’s mother, a college education is not the top priority and working in the factory to help her sister is of utmost importance; therefore, she feels it should also be of utmost importance to Ana” (89).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ana’s first day in Estella’s factory</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_3/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this scene, Ana comes to work at Estella’s factory for the first time. Ana begins to admire one of Estella’s dresses, to which her mom remarks “You’ll never fit into that one. It’s a size 7” (00:13:31). Two workers in the factory, Norma and Panchita, enter and are introduced to Ana. Carmen makes a fat-shaming comment to Panchita, which is poorly received. In general, the atmosphere in the factory and between the workers is tense, hostile, and unfriendly. As they begin to work, Estella explains that they gets paid 18 dollars for each dress they assemble, although Norma explains that the dresses are then sold at Bloomingdale’s for 600 dollars, which provokes outrage in Ana (00:17:20).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later on, the workers begin to exchange &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em>, or gossip, with each other. In an act of “spilling tea,” Carmen shares that Dorado Ortiz, a local man, is in love with Rosalí, one of the employees at the factory. Carmen in this regard says, “he would love to fatten you up, but don’t get as fat as Ana” (00:18:23). Fed up with these comments, Ana runs out of the factory, and her mom chases her. Carmen cannot chase her for long, for she collapses with exhaustion. She bemoans to Ana that she’s too tired to do the factory work nowadays: her hands are arthritic and she’s losing her eyesight. Speaking to her in Spanish, Carmen says to Ana [translated]: “Are you ashamed to work with us? So much hard work. So much sacrifice. And all for what? For you two. You just think I’m a dog that’s only good for working” (00:20:16).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene2_1.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scene importantly comments on the economic exploitation of Latino immigrant workers, whose vulnerabilities lead them to take jobs in industries known for poor wages and working conditions. The textile industry is a prime example. Indeed, the atmosphere in Estela’s factory is highly reminiscent of the &lt;em>maquilas&lt;/em> of Mexico. The shocking disparity between the production and commercial value of Estela’s dresses further cements the idea that society considers Latino labor to be low-skill and cheap despite the fact that this labor is ultimately indispensable to corporate profitability and success. Limited class and financial mobility is a pervasive border, yet Ana shows resistance to the normalization of the devaluation of Latin labor in this scene and throughout the film. Scholar Juanita Heredia corroborates by writing:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>By situating the women’s labor force at Estela’s factory in the film, Cardoso critiques Latina women’s working conditions in the garment industry in relationship to globalization. Ana, at first considered an outsider, becomes aware of the economic inequalities that exist between the Latina seamstresses working for her sister Estela in the factory and the corporate world represented by Bloomingdale’s, which reflects a social and economic hierarchy within metropolitan Los Angeles (11).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Dually, this scene also showcases the divide between the first generation immigrant culture and second generation immigrant experience with Ana and Carmen’s exchange on the street. Carmen expresses her grievances at how much she works and dedicates to a family that looks down on the type of labor she does. Again, Carmen exemplifies the values of hard work, family-centrism, and sacrifice expected of older immigrant generations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Difundiendo chismes</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_5/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene2_2.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this scene, Carmen is shown initiating &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em> with the other factory workers about Norma. It was revealed in a previous scene that Norma had to leave the factory because she was moving back to Mexico to get married. Her two sisters and mother—who also worked in the factory—were moving back to Mexico with her, causing Estella to lose four seamstresses and dress production to greatly slow. While gossiping, Carmen says that Norma’s fiancé convinced her to have sex with him the night before the wedding, and the following day, the fiancé never showed up to the ceremony. Carmen shames Norma, to which Ana engages in the conversion, and they have the following exchange (00:39:28-00:39:57):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ana&lt;/strong>: Mom, you’re so old fashioned.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Mom&lt;/strong>: Girls nowadays think they know so much. That’s why they end up panzona.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Ana&lt;/strong>: No mom. The reason they end up pregnant is because they don’t know how to use contraceptives.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Mom&lt;/strong>: Your husband is not going to like you knowing so much…A man wants a virgin.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Ana&lt;/strong>: Why is a woman’s virginity the only thing that matters? A woman has thoughts, ideas, a mind of her own.\&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Here, we see what started as mere &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em> open up a dialogue regarding sexuality and notions of ‘purity’. Scholars theorize that gossip is “an oral practice of sharing information to affirm and/or police membership in social groups” (Gutierrez 111). Scholar Lizeth Gutierrez goes further to say that these &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em> scenes within the film allow “immigrant women to create an alternative definition of emotional security that centers community, fights back against patriarchy, and produces feminist knowledge” (111). When Ana joins in the gossip, it is to challenge Carmen’s misconceptions regarding sex and pregnancy as well as renounce the demonization of sex outside of marriage. Here, we see another way in which Ana strays from the norm in how she rejects “the sexual abstinence ideal Latina adolescents receive from their families, communities, and culture” (Guerrero 90). Viewers also learn that gossip is not inherently bad; while it can be used to alienate and demean others, it can also be used to challenge norms and create solidarity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 11: Ana goes off to college</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_11/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene11_1.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this final scene, Ana is preparing to go to the airport to head to New York City. She has already received support for her decision from the whole family besides her mom. Ana speaks to her mom through her locked door, asking her to please come outside and give her blessing to Ana. Carmen is shown deliberating in her room, pacing back and forth and looking at Ana’s photo dejectedly. Ana has to leave for the airport without saying goodbye; she goes with her dad and grandfather. Subversively, we see the men of the family seeing Ana off and supporting her dreams. The grandfather, who had continuously supported Ana throughout the movie, tells Ana not to worry about him and that he will always have her in his heart. The movie ends with Ana on the streets of New York City, awkwardly attempting to “walk like a lady” like her mother would always tell her to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene11_2.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this heart-warming conclusion to a wonderful and moving story, the audience is left with a bittersweet feeling. While many of us were rooting for Ana to go to college, many of us also wanted to see Ana rebuild her relationship with her mom and get Carmen to recognize how she mistreated Ana. Instead, we see nothing of the latter in these last scenes. While this may be upsetting to many, it is nonetheless a realistic portrayal of a mother&amp;rsquo;s resistance to change even at the expense of her daughter’s happiness and wellbeing. Throughout the posts, I’ve explored many features of Latino families and cultures that are spotlighted in this movie: collectivism, family-centrism, gender roles, financial sacrifice, and religion. Many of these features act to the detriment of female autonomy and persist across multiple generations, making it even harder to dismantle traditional notions of femininity and the ‘ideal Latina woman.’ Indeed, “it is not Ana turning her back on the women in the film but rather her mother refusing to accept her daughter’s individuality. The approval by every other character of Ana’s plans, then, is a narrative device that exposes the senselessness of Carmen’s cleaving to outdated traditions, and it is this insistence that creates the divisions in the family” (Leen 10). In the final scene, Ana tries to talk the way her mom would nag her to, coming off as an attempt to reconnect with her mother despite leaving things off on tense terms. By the end of the movie, the audience knows that this isn’t a story with a clear victim and villain but rather a character study of two strong-willed Chicana women attempting to navigate spaces that aren’t made for them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The San Antonio statue</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_4/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this scene, Carmen is shown hanging up a San Antonio statue for Ana. She reveals she also hung one up for Estela 11 years ago when she first turned 18. The statues are importantly shown hanging upside down. This brief snippet showcases the influences of Catholicism in Latin American culture and folklore. Saint Anthony of Padua is known as a miracle worker who helps people find things they’ve lost. When hung upside down, he is invoked to quell issues with love and romance and help people leave singlehood. In hanging these up, Carmen shows she is hoping her daughters get married soon. Despite both daughters still being quite young, Carmen’s preoccupation with their marital status speaks again to the prevalence of gender roles and expectations for women in Latino households. In these conservative traditions, marriage is considered the most important path for a woman, and therefore their value is inherently linked to how eligible they are for marriage—which draws on shallow notions of beauty and desirability.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
