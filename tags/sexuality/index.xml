&lt;p>In this scene, Ana goes to the pharmacy to pick up a cigar for her grandfather and also decides to buy condoms for the first time. She later goes over to Jimmy’s house when his parents aren’t over, and she initiates sex with Jimmy—her first time. Before they begin, Ana asks him to turn on the lights, saying “I want you to see me,” drawing his attention to her naked body which has been the subject of ridicule from her mother throughout the movie (01:04:14). Jimmy responds with “que bonita” in Spanish. After they’ve had sex and Ana is getting ready to leave, she says Jimmy doesn’t have to write to her when they start college or worry about her anymore, saying “you’ll probably end up meeting some skinny girl, right?” (01:05:13).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The next day, Carmen catches Ana admiring her naked body in the mirror. Carmen immediately begins to yell at Ana, inferring that she has lost her virginity. She calls her a tramp and says “you’re not only fat, you’re a puta!” (1:06:31). Ana retorts by saying “there’s more to me than what’s in between my legs” to which Carmen then slaps her in the face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot can be unpacked from these scenes. At first, Ana’s friendly and positive interaction with the pharmacy clerk helps to destigmatize the action of buying condoms and engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage. Heredia continues with an interpretation of the scene that I believe is spot-on:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cardoso purposefully emphasizes Ana’s body as that of a woman of color with curves. Instead of encouraging her daughter, Ana’s mother is disappointed because she is overweight and thus, not as eligible for marriage in her mother’s view. The spectator witnesses a double marginalization. By taking Jimmy as a “secret” boyfriend and lover, Ana declares her own sexual revolution and liberation in that she is following her own mind and desires by refusing to be a virgin until marriage, thereby contesting cultural expectations (9).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Further, Ana’s intimacy with Jimmy began as consensual, empowering, and body positive only for her to revert to her insecurities when she accuses Jimmy of likely abandoning her for a skinny girl once they go to college. Guerrero has an interesting take on what may be transpiring in Ana’s mind during this scene:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Carmen’s opinions serve to reflect the always present tension in blending her first generation immigrant culture with that of American society and expectations of her daughter’s second generation immigrant experience. Thus, some may see Ana’s first sexual experiences as a reflection of a confused culture. However, others may see that Ana’s decision to become sexually active is a symbol of reclaiming her own power (90).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this scene, Carmen is shown initiating &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em> with the other factory workers about Norma. It was revealed in a previous scene that Norma had to leave the factory because she was moving back to Mexico to get married. Her two sisters and mother—who also worked in the factory—were moving back to Mexico with her, causing Estella to lose four seamstresses and dress production to greatly slow. While gossiping, Carmen says that Norma’s fiancé convinced her to have sex with him the night before the wedding, and the following day, the fiancé never showed up to the ceremony. Carmen shames Norma, to which Ana engages in the conversion, and they have the following exchange (00:39:28-00:39:57):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ana&lt;/strong>: Mom, you’re so old fashioned.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Mom&lt;/strong>: Girls nowadays think they know so much. That’s why they end up panzona.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Ana&lt;/strong>: No mom. The reason they end up pregnant is because they don’t know how to use contraceptives.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Mom&lt;/strong>: Your husband is not going to like you knowing so much…A man wants a virgin.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Ana&lt;/strong>: Why is a woman’s virginity the only thing that matters? A woman has thoughts, ideas, a mind of her own.\&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Here, we see what started as mere &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em> open up a dialogue regarding sexuality and notions of ‘purity’. Scholars theorize that gossip is “an oral practice of sharing information to affirm and/or police membership in social groups” (Gutierrez 111). Scholar Lizeth Gutierrez goes further to say that these &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em> scenes within the film allow “immigrant women to create an alternative definition of emotional security that centers community, fights back against patriarchy, and produces feminist knowledge” (111). When Ana joins in the gossip, it is to challenge Carmen’s misconceptions regarding sex and pregnancy as well as renounce the demonization of sex outside of marriage. Here, we see another way in which Ana strays from the norm in how she rejects “the sexual abstinence ideal Latina adolescents receive from their families, communities, and culture” (Guerrero 90). Viewers also learn that gossip is not inherently bad; while it can be used to alienate and demean others, it can also be used to challenge norms and create solidarity.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
