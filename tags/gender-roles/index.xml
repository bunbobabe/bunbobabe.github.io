The dad is shown displaying open-mindedness to the idea of Ana going to college whereas Ana’s mom is obstinately against the idea. Carmen goes on a brief spiel in Spanish, saying [translated] “I can educate her. I can teach her to sew. I can teach her to raise her kids. Tend to her husband. They’re not going to teach her those things in college…It’s a question of principles. It’s just not fair. I’ve worked since I was 13 years old. Ana is 18 years old. It’s her turn now” (00:10:15-00:10:31).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This scene is essential to understanding the gender roles and gendered expectations present within this particular Mexican-American family and within Latino families at-large. Sadly enough, women are often agents of patriarchy within Latino households. As Scholar Catherine Leen writes: “Carmen’s sole opposition to Ana’s plans underlines the fact that…the family matriarch can be more machista than any patriarch” (5). Additionally, when Carmen says “it’s just not fair,” the scene insinuates that Carmen is harboring resentment and jealousy toward Ana since she is being given opportunities she never had the opportunity of pursuing. When Carmen was growing up in Mexico, she likely did not have supportive male figures like Mr. Guzman who encouraged her to obtain an education. Although it’s wrong for her to control Ana’s life, Carmen’s acceptance and perpetuation of gender roles are reflections of patriarchal ideas and systems that are endemic to Latin America and serve to oppress women across generations. For these reasons, Carmen’s resentment toward Ana may also explain why she is always body shaming her. As one movie reviewer writes: “Part of [Carmen’s] impatience with Ana comes from a sense of competition, an element that Ms. Cardoso and the writers, Josefina Lopez and George LaVoo, don&amp;rsquo;t make overly explicit” (Mitchell).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The San Antonio statue</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_4/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this scene, Carmen is shown hanging up a San Antonio statue for Ana. She reveals she also hung one up for Estela 11 years ago when she first turned 18. The statues are importantly shown hanging upside down. This brief snippet showcases the influences of Catholicism in Latin American culture and folklore. Saint Anthony of Padua is known as a miracle worker who helps people find things they’ve lost. When hung upside down, he is invoked to quell issues with love and romance and help people leave singlehood. In hanging these up, Carmen shows she is hoping her daughters get married soon. Despite both daughters still being quite young, Carmen’s preoccupation with their marital status speaks again to the prevalence of gender roles and expectations for women in Latino households. In these conservative traditions, marriage is considered the most important path for a woman, and therefore their value is inherently linked to how eligible they are for marriage—which draws on shallow notions of beauty and desirability.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
