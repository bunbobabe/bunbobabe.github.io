Ana’s dad offers her some cake, to which Ana’s mother, Carmen, replies, “can’t you see she’s bigger than the cake?” in Spanish (00:007:28). This is the first of a slew of body-shaming remarks that the mom makes against Ana’s weight and body shape. The parents then ask Ana why she quit her job at a fast food restaurant, which viewers saw in a previous scene, and the mom says Ana will come to work in her sister, Estella’s, dress-making factory.</description></item><item><title>Scene Analysis: The San Antonio statue</title><link>/posts/post_3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/post_3/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
