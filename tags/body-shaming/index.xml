Ana’s dad offers her some cake, to which Ana’s mother, Carmen, replies [translated], “can’t you see she’s bigger than the cake?” in Spanish (00:007:28). This is the first of a slew of body-shaming remarks that the mom makes against Ana’s weight and body shape. The parents then ask Ana why she quit her job at a fast food restaurant, which viewers saw in a previous scene, and the mom says Ana will come to work in her sister, Estella’s, dress-making factory. As her mom ropes her into a new job, Mr. Guzman, Ana’s high school English teacher, arrives at the graduation party. He implores Ana’s parents to consider sending Ana to college and explains there are scholarship options for her. The parents respond indignantly, explaining that they have thought about Ana’s college education but need Ana to work. Mr. Guzman leaves the party, and Ana is shown with a forlorn but accepting look on her face.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This expository scene lays the groundwork for many of the film&amp;rsquo;s recurring themes and topics—such as Ana getting body shamed by Carmen and Ana’s parents questioning the role of higher education in her life. A central point of tension within the movie is the generational and cultural discrepancy between first and second generation immigrants, with Ana representing a contemporary and progressive Chicana whereas Carmen represents an immigrant Chicana still grounded in tradition. Ana’s parents don’t want her to pursue higher education because they view it as contradictory to the collectivist family unit that is at the heart of many Latin American cultures. Indeed, “Latin American cultures with a collectivistic orientation emphasize the goals and interests of the group over those of individual members. A critical aspect of a collectivistic ideology is a strong concern for the fate and well-being of one’s kin, and family members within collectivistic cultures often are expected to support each other and assist in the maintenance of the household” (Guerrero 86). This explains why Carmen is so insistent that Ana stay and help with Estela’s business. Although Ana remains placid in this scene, she has not given up on her hopes of going to college. As viewers will see throughout the rest of the movie, Ana’s individualist attitude toward higher education will continue to embolden the rift between her and her mom in addition to challenging the notion of collectivism within the Latino family.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 10: Stretch marks, cellulite, and real women</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_10/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_10/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this scene, the women of Estela’s factory are close to completing a big dress order. Exasperated by the hot and suffocating conditions of the factory, Ana takes her shirt off to cool down. Carmen immediately disparages her appearance, telling her she looks awful. Estela, Pancha, and Rosalí come to Ana’s defense, telling her she looks beautiful. Each woman begins to talk about her own insecurities, such as her cellulite, stretch marks, and fat and in doing so, starts to strip off her clothes to show the others. They jokingly compare their bodies to orcas and elephants and in these self-deprecating comments, they find solidarity in their shared body types and weights. Carmen scorns all of them, to which Ana responds: “Make myself attractive so I can catch a man?…I do want to lose weight, but part of me doesn’t because my weight says to everybody FUCK you…how dare anybody tell what I should look like or what I should be. There’s so much more to me than just my weight…This is who we are mama. Real women” (01:13:08).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene10.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scene could almost be interpreted as the climax of the movie, where the audience finally sees the characters talk about their curvy body types in positive ways. Heredia writes: “Like Ana, Cardoso demonstrates in this scene the Latina’s “declaration of independence,” through pride in her body in a city context and one who prefers to follow her own dictates in defining beauty and aesthetics on her own terms as real women should” (12). Although the women are not saying overtly loving things about their bodies and features, their acceptance of their curviness, which is so heavily demonized by Carmen and societal beauty standards alike, acts as a form of resistance. Ironically, a hot sweatshop—which earlier in the movie represented financial exploitation and repression of the Latino workforce—now acts as a space of liberation and reclaiming one’s womanhood. Additionally, in choosing not to join the women, Carmen remains trapped in her own bitterness and insecurities, showing that long-standing patriarchal forms of thinking take time to dismantle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ana’s first day in Estella’s factory</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_3/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this scene, Ana comes to work at Estella’s factory for the first time. Ana begins to admire one of Estella’s dresses, to which her mom remarks “You’ll never fit into that one. It’s a size 7” (00:13:31). Two workers in the factory, Norma and Panchita, enter and are introduced to Ana. Carmen makes a fat-shaming comment to Panchita, which is poorly received. In general, the atmosphere in the factory and between the workers is tense, hostile, and unfriendly. As they begin to work, Estella explains that they gets paid 18 dollars for each dress they assemble, although Norma explains that the dresses are then sold at Bloomingdale’s for 600 dollars, which provokes outrage in Ana (00:17:20).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later on, the workers begin to exchange &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em>, or gossip, with each other. In an act of “spilling tea,” Carmen shares that Dorado Ortiz, a local man, is in love with Rosalí, one of the employees at the factory. Carmen in this regard says, “he would love to fatten you up, but don’t get as fat as Ana” (00:18:23). Fed up with these comments, Ana runs out of the factory, and her mom chases her. Carmen cannot chase her for long, for she collapses with exhaustion. She bemoans to Ana that she’s too tired to do the factory work nowadays: her hands are arthritic and she’s losing her eyesight. Speaking to her in Spanish, Carmen says to Ana [translated]: “Are you ashamed to work with us? So much hard work. So much sacrifice. And all for what? For you two. You just think I’m a dog that’s only good for working” (00:20:16).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene2_1.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scene importantly comments on the economic exploitation of Latino immigrant workers, whose vulnerabilities lead them to take jobs in industries known for poor wages and working conditions. The textile industry is a prime example. Indeed, the atmosphere in Estela’s factory is highly reminiscent of the &lt;em>maquilas&lt;/em> of Mexico. The shocking disparity between the production and commercial value of Estela’s dresses further cements the idea that society considers Latino labor to be low-skill and cheap despite the fact that this labor is ultimately indispensable to corporate profitability and success. Limited class and financial mobility is a pervasive border, yet Ana shows resistance to the normalization of the devaluation of Latin labor in this scene and throughout the film. Scholar Juanita Heredia corroborates by writing:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>By situating the women’s labor force at Estela’s factory in the film, Cardoso critiques Latina women’s working conditions in the garment industry in relationship to globalization. Ana, at first considered an outsider, becomes aware of the economic inequalities that exist between the Latina seamstresses working for her sister Estela in the factory and the corporate world represented by Bloomingdale’s, which reflects a social and economic hierarchy within metropolitan Los Angeles (11).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Dually, this scene also showcases the divide between the first generation immigrant culture and second generation immigrant experience with Ana and Carmen’s exchange on the street. Carmen expresses her grievances at how much she works and dedicates to a family that looks down on the type of labor she does. Again, Carmen exemplifies the values of hard work, family-centrism, and sacrifice expected of older immigrant generations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 9: Don’t eat the flan!</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_9/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here, Ana and Carmen are in a restaurant after finishing at the doctor’s office. Throughout the movie, Carmen had insisted to Ana that she was pregnant although Ana never took her seriously. At the doctor’s, he confirms that Carmen is not pregnant but is undergoing “&lt;em>el cambio de vida&lt;/em>,” or menopause, to her incredulity and disbelief. At the restaurant white eating a flan, Carmen has finally wrapped her head around it, saying “I’m no longer a woman…A grandmother is what I should be at this age” (1:07:18). As Carmen questions her own womanhood, she begins to scrutinize Ana’s, telling her she should lose weight so she can be more desirable for a man. Ana sharply fires back: “You’re overweight too. So why should I listen to you?”(1:08:30). Ana begins to pull the plate of flan toward her, as her mom yells at her to not eat the flan. Ana then takes a big bite, cementing her resistance to her mother’s outdated and oppressive notions of womanhood and the female body.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene9.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scene revisits the scrutiny of the female body within Latino communities and again highlights the notion that many believe keeping a slim figure is important to increase marriage prospects. It also highlights the hypocrisy and self-hatred within many Latina women, since Carmen shames bigger bodies despite being overweight herself. This again speaks to the idea that the traditional Latina woman must define herself relative to men and the male gaze, which, at the time that the movie was made, idolized skinniness as the beauty standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, researchers became inspired by the discourse generated by this film and researched how Latina girls are affected by beauty standards and perceive beauty within themselves and their communities. In their study, the researchers interviewed 27 Latina mid-adolescent girls (ages 14 to 16) regarding their perceptions of what body shapes and sizes are valued in Latino culture and European American culture. They came to the conclusion that “there was an overwhelming consensus that a slender but curvy figure is the ideal body type in Latino culture and that European Americans value unnaturally thin physiques. Themes drawn from the adolescents’ responses point to their friends’ opinions, perceptions of boys’ dating preferences, norms in their communities, and body shapes of female celebrities in Latino media outlets as sources of beauty and desirability” (111). This importantly demonstrates that Latino media also plays a role on how young women form their thoughts surrounding body image expectations. In spotlighting curvy women with body image struggles, hopefully the film helps to destigmatize bigger bodies within the Latino community at-large.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
