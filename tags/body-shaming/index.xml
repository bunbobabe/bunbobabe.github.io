      <description>In this scene, Ana comes to work at Estella’s factory for the first time. Ana begins to admire one of Estella’s dresses, to which her mom remarks “You’ll never fit into that one. It’s a size 7” (00:13:31). Two workers in the factory, Norma and Panchita, enter and are introduced to Ana. Carmen makes a fat-shaming comment to Panchita, which is poorly received. In general, the atmosphere in the factory and between the workers is tense, hostile, and unfriendly.</description>

      <description>In this scene, Ana comes back from her last day of high school to see that her family has thrown her a surprise graduation party. Ana’s dad offers her some cake, to which Ana’s mother, Carmen, replies [translated], “can’t you see she’s bigger than the cake?” in Spanish (00:007:28). This is the first of a slew of body-shaming remarks that the mom makes against Ana’s weight and body shape. The parents then ask Ana why she quit her job at a fast food restaurant, which viewers saw in a previous scene, and the mom says Ana will come to work in her sister, Estella’s, dress-making factory.</description>

      <description>In this scene, the women of Estela’s factory are close to completing a big dress order. Exasperated by the hot and suffocating conditions of the factory, Ana takes her shirt off to cool down. Carmen immediately disparages her appearance, telling her she looks awful. Estela, Pancha, and Rosalí come to Ana’s defense, telling her she looks beautiful. Each woman begins to talk about her own insecurities, such as her cellulite, stretch marks, and fat and in doing so, starts to strip off her clothes to show the others.</description>

      <description>Here, Ana and Carmen are in a restaurant after finishing at the doctor’s office. Throughout the movie, Carmen had insisted to Ana that she was pregnant although Ana never took her seriously. At the doctor’s, he confirms that Carmen is not pregnant but is undergoing “el cambio de vida,” or menopause, to her incredulity and disbelief. At the restaurant white eating a flan, Carmen has finally wrapped her head around it, saying “I’m no longer a woman…A grandmother is what I should be at this age” (1:07:18).</description>
