Exasperated by the hot and suffocating conditions of the factory, Ana takes her shirt off to cool down. Carmen immediately disparages her appearance, telling her she looks awful. Estela, Pancha, and Rosalí come to Ana’s defense, telling her she looks beautiful. Each woman begins to talk about her own insecurities, such as her cellulite, stretch marks, and fat and in doing so, starts to strip off her clothes to show the others. They jokingly compare their bodies to orcas and elephants and in these self-deprecating comments, they find solidarity in their shared body types and weights. Carmen scorns all of them, to which Ana responds: “Make myself attractive so I can catch a man?…I do want to lose weight, but part of me doesn’t because my weight says to everybody FUCK you…how dare anybody tell what I should look like or what I should be. There’s so much more to me than just my weight…This is who we are mama. Real women” (01:13:08).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene10.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scene could almost be interpreted as the climax of the movie, where the audience finally sees the characters talk about their curvy body types in positive ways. Heredia writes: “Like Ana, Cardoso demonstrates in this scene the Latina’s “declaration of independence,” through pride in her body in a city context and one who prefers to follow her own dictates in defining beauty and aesthetics on her own terms as real women should” (12). Although the women are not saying overtly loving things about their bodies and features, their acceptance of their curviness, which is so heavily demonized by Carmen and societal beauty standards alike, acts as a form of resistance. Ironically, a hot sweatshop—which earlier in the movie represented financial exploitation and repression of the Latino workforce—now acts as a space of liberation and reclaiming one’s womanhood. Additionally, in choosing not to join the women, Carmen remains trapped in her own bitterness and insecurities, showing that long-standing patriarchal forms of thinking take time to dismantle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 11: Ana goes off to college</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_11/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_11/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene11_1.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this final scene, Ana is preparing to go to the airport to head to New York City. She has already received support for her decision from the whole family besides her mom. Ana speaks to her mom through her locked door, asking her to please come outside and give her blessing to Ana. Carmen is shown deliberating in her room, pacing back and forth and looking at Ana’s photo dejectedly. Ana has to leave for the airport without saying goodbye; she goes with her dad and grandfather. Subversively, we see the men of the family seeing Ana off and supporting her dreams. The grandfather, who had continuously supported Ana throughout the movie, tells Ana not to worry about him and that he will always have her in his heart. The movie ends with Ana on the streets of New York City, awkwardly attempting to “walk like a lady” like her mother would always tell her to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene11_2.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this heart-warming conclusion to a wonderful and moving story, the audience is left with a bittersweet feeling. While many of us were rooting for Ana to go to college, many of us also wanted to see Ana rebuild her relationship with her mom and get Carmen to recognize how she mistreated Ana. Instead, we see nothing of the latter in these last scenes. While this may be upsetting to many, it is nonetheless a realistic portrayal of a mother&amp;rsquo;s resistance to change even at the expense of her daughter’s happiness and wellbeing. Throughout the posts, I’ve explored many features of Latino families and cultures that are spotlighted in this movie: collectivism, family-centrism, gender roles, financial sacrifice, and religion. Many of these features act to the detriment of female autonomy and persist across multiple generations, making it even harder to dismantle traditional notions of femininity and the ‘ideal Latina woman.’ Indeed, “it is not Ana turning her back on the women in the film but rather her mother refusing to accept her daughter’s individuality. The approval by every other character of Ana’s plans, then, is a narrative device that exposes the senselessness of Carmen’s cleaving to outdated traditions, and it is this insistence that creates the divisions in the family” (Leen 10). In the final scene, Ana tries to talk the way her mom would nag her to, coming off as an attempt to reconnect with her mother despite leaving things off on tense terms. By the end of the movie, the audience knows that this isn’t a story with a clear victim and villain but rather a character study of two strong-willed Chicana women attempting to navigate spaces that aren’t made for them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 8: Cigars and Condoms</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_8/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_8/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene8_1.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this scene, Ana goes to the pharmacy to pick up a cigar for her grandfather and also decides to buy condoms for the first time. She later goes over to Jimmy’s house when his parents aren’t over, and she initiates sex with Jimmy—her first time. Before they begin, Ana asks him to turn on the lights, saying “I want you to see me,” drawing his attention to her naked body which has been the subject of ridicule from her mother throughout the movie (01:04:14). Jimmy responds with “que bonita” in Spanish. After they’ve had sex and Ana is getting ready to leave, she says Jimmy doesn’t have to write to her when they start college or worry about her anymore, saying “you’ll probably end up meeting some skinny girl, right?” (01:05:13).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene8_2.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day, Carmen catches Ana admiring her naked body in the mirror. Carmen immediately begins to yell at Ana, inferring that she has lost her virginity. She calls her a tramp and says “you’re not only fat, you’re a puta!” (1:06:31). Ana retorts by saying “there’s more to me than what’s in between my legs” to which Carmen then slaps her in the face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot can be unpacked from these scenes. At first, Ana’s friendly and positive interaction with the pharmacy clerk helps to destigmatize the action of buying condoms and engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage. Heredia continues with an interpretation of the scene that I believe is spot-on:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cardoso purposefully emphasizes Ana’s body as that of a woman of color with curves. Instead of encouraging her daughter, Ana’s mother is disappointed because she is overweight and thus, not as eligible for marriage in her mother’s view. The spectator witnesses a double marginalization. By taking Jimmy as a “secret” boyfriend and lover, Ana declares her own sexual revolution and liberation in that she is following her own mind and desires by refusing to be a virgin until marriage, thereby contesting cultural expectations (9).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Further, Ana’s intimacy with Jimmy began as consensual, empowering, and body positive only for her to revert to her insecurities when she accuses Jimmy of likely abandoning her for a skinny girl once they go to college. Guerrero has an interesting take on what may be transpiring in Ana’s mind during this scene:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Carmen’s opinions serve to reflect the always present tension in blending her first generation immigrant culture with that of American society and expectations of her daughter’s second generation immigrant experience. Thus, some may see Ana’s first sexual experiences as a reflection of a confused culture. However, others may see that Ana’s decision to become sexually active is a symbol of reclaiming her own power (90).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Scene 9: Don’t eat the flan!</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_9/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_9/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here, Ana and Carmen are in a restaurant after finishing at the doctor’s office. Throughout the movie, Carmen had insisted to Ana that she was pregnant although Ana never took her seriously. At the doctor’s, he confirms that Carmen is not pregnant but is undergoing “&lt;em>el cambio de vida&lt;/em>,” or menopause, to her incredulity and disbelief. At the restaurant white eating a flan, Carmen has finally wrapped her head around it, saying “I’m no longer a woman…A grandmother is what I should be at this age” (1:07:18). As Carmen questions her own womanhood, she begins to scrutinize Ana’s, telling her she should lose weight so she can be more desirable for a man. Ana sharply fires back: “You’re overweight too. So why should I listen to you?”(1:08:30). Ana begins to pull the plate of flan toward her, as her mom yells at her to not eat the flan. Ana then takes a big bite, cementing her resistance to her mother’s outdated and oppressive notions of womanhood and the female body.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene9.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scene revisits the scrutiny of the female body within Latino communities and again highlights the notion that many believe keeping a slim figure is important to increase marriage prospects. It also highlights the hypocrisy and self-hatred within many Latina women, since Carmen shames bigger bodies despite being overweight herself. This again speaks to the idea that the traditional Latina woman must define herself relative to men and the male gaze, which, at the time that the movie was made, idolized skinniness as the beauty standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, researchers became inspired by the discourse generated by this film and researched how Latina girls are affected by beauty standards and perceive beauty within themselves and their communities. In their study, the researchers interviewed 27 Latina mid-adolescent girls (ages 14 to 16) regarding their perceptions of what body shapes and sizes are valued in Latino culture and European American culture. They came to the conclusion that “there was an overwhelming consensus that a slender but curvy figure is the ideal body type in Latino culture and that European Americans value unnaturally thin physiques. Themes drawn from the adolescents’ responses point to their friends’ opinions, perceptions of boys’ dating preferences, norms in their communities, and body shapes of female celebrities in Latino media outlets as sources of beauty and desirability” (111). This importantly demonstrates that Latino media also plays a role on how young women form their thoughts surrounding body image expectations. In spotlighting curvy women with body image struggles, hopefully the film helps to destigmatize bigger bodies within the Latino community at-large.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 5: Difundiendo chismes</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_5/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene2_2.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this scene, Carmen is shown initiating &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em> with the other factory workers about Norma. It was revealed in a previous scene that Norma had to leave the factory because she was moving back to Mexico to get married. Her two sisters and mother—who also worked in the factory—were moving back to Mexico with her, causing Estella to lose four seamstresses and dress production to greatly slow. While gossiping, Carmen says that Norma’s fiancé convinced her to have sex with him the night before the wedding, and the following day, the fiancé never showed up to the ceremony. Carmen shames Norma, to which Ana engages in the conversion, and they have the following exchange (00:39:28-00:39:57):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ana&lt;/strong>: Mom, you’re so old fashioned.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Mom&lt;/strong>: Girls nowadays think they know so much. That’s why they end up panzona.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Ana&lt;/strong>: No mom. The reason they end up pregnant is because they don’t know how to use contraceptives.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Mom&lt;/strong>: Your husband is not going to like you knowing so much…A man wants a virgin.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Ana&lt;/strong>: Why is a woman’s virginity the only thing that matters? A woman has thoughts, ideas, a mind of her own.\&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Here, we see what started as mere &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em> open up a dialogue regarding sexuality and notions of ‘purity’. Scholars theorize that gossip is “an oral practice of sharing information to affirm and/or police membership in social groups” (Gutierrez 111). Scholar Lizeth Gutierrez goes further to say that these &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em> scenes within the film allow “immigrant women to create an alternative definition of emotional security that centers community, fights back against patriarchy, and produces feminist knowledge” (111). When Ana joins in the gossip, it is to challenge Carmen’s misconceptions regarding sex and pregnancy as well as renounce the demonization of sex outside of marriage. Here, we see another way in which Ana strays from the norm in how she rejects “the sexual abstinence ideal Latina adolescents receive from their families, communities, and culture” (Guerrero 90). Viewers also learn that gossip is not inherently bad; while it can be used to alienate and demean others, it can also be used to challenge norms and create solidarity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 6: Meeting Latina Girlboss (?) Mrs. Glass</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_6/</guid><description>&lt;p>Because Estela has lost four seamstresses and is behind on dress production, she is struggling to pay the electricity and rent bills for the factory. Estela is shown emailing Mrs. Glass, the owner of the manufacturing company that buys Estella’s dresses and sells them at Bloomingdale’s, to ask for an advance on the payment for the dresses. Ana is bewildered, asking why Estela is emailing her instead of going to see Mrs. Glass in person. Estela responds timidly, saying Mrs. Glass is too busy to see her. Ana infers that Estela is scared of her, but in the following scene, Ana has convinced Estela to go with her to the corporate office to talk to Mrs. Glass. They catch her in the hallway, and Estela asks about the advance payment. Mrs. Glass responds in a cold manner: “Estela, you know the rules. I can’t pay advances. I went out on a limb to hire you in the first place because I believe a woman like me should help a woman like you. But I can only help you so much. You have to help yourself and meet your deadlines…You have until the end of the month” (42:00).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene5_1.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Surprised by Mrs. Glass’ apathy, Ana speaks to her sister in Spanish, saying [translated], “she’s worse than you said.” Mrs. Glass turns around and immediately retorts, saying in unaccented Spanish [translated]: “Did you say something, Estella?” From this, we can infer that Mrs. Glass is likely also Latina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene5_2.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Analogous to Ana’s antagonistic relationship with Carmen, we see Mrs. Glass’ severity and callousness toward Estela despite both of them being working Latinas. I believe this scene serves to comment on the existence of class privileges and divides within the Latino community itself. The case of Mrs. Glass shows that when some Latinos are able to overcome the borders hindering their economic mobility and find, in relative terms, “success,” they can still manage to look down upon and perpetuate the subjugation of other Latinos. Mrs. Glass makes no exceptions for Estela, saying “you have to help yourself”—which echoes the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” sentiment often thrown around in contemporary discourse surrounding immigrant labor. Mrs. Glass’ words also gleam with condescension and self-gratification from the idea that she has already given Estela several handouts. While brief, this scene importantly highlighted the systemic factors that constrict working class Latinos in addition to the dichotomy within the Latino community surrounding class, success, and stereotypes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 7: Ana gets into Columbia</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_7/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this scene, Mr. Guzman comes to Ana’s house to tell her she has gotten into Columbia with a full scholarship. Ana is elated, but her parents are dismayed when they find out Columbia is in New York City, all the way across the country. Mr. Guzman does his best to convince the parents to let her go, saying “you left your country for a better opportunity. And now it’s Ana’s turn.” The dad responds with: “Ana is going to go to college, but not now. I didn’t come this far to see my family break apart.” The mom further tries to guilt Ana for wanting to leave for college. She behooves her by saying “What about Estella and the factory? What about &lt;em>abuelo&lt;/em>? You want to abandon him?” Due to the lack of support from both of her parents, Ana accepts that she will not be going to Columbia, and Mr. Guzman leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene6.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scene revisits the idea of the nuclear/collectivist Latino family unit that carves out set pathways for its youngest members to follow. Ana’s divergence from such a path, which involves staying close to home to support her family, is interpreted as not just abandoning her family but her culture and values. The viewer may be feeling frustrated at this point by the fact that Ana’s parents have not really provided concrete reasons as to why she can’t attend college. Shouldn’t the prestige of Columbia and the full financial scholarship eliminate almost all barriers? In addition to temporarily fracturing the family dynamic, Ana’s parents may not consider college to be worth it in terms of financial mobility. Scholar Jeanne Guerrero posts that “facing limited employment opportunities, many immigrants view self-employment as a route to upward mobility…In the eyes of Ana’s mother, a college education is not the top priority and working in the factory to help her sister is of utmost importance; therefore, she feels it should also be of utmost importance to Ana” (89).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 1: Can’t you see she’s bigger than the cake?</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_1/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this scene, Ana comes back from her last day of high school to see that her family has thrown her a surprise graduation party. Ana’s dad offers her some cake, to which Ana’s mother, Carmen, replies [translated], “can’t you see she’s bigger than the cake?” in Spanish (00:007:28). This is the first of a slew of body-shaming remarks that the mom makes against Ana’s weight and body shape. The parents then ask Ana why she quit her job at a fast food restaurant, which viewers saw in a previous scene, and the mom says Ana will come to work in her sister, Estella’s, dress-making factory. As her mom ropes her into a new job, Mr. Guzman, Ana’s high school English teacher, arrives at the graduation party. He implores Ana’s parents to consider sending Ana to college and explains there are scholarship options for her. The parents respond indignantly, explaining that they have thought about Ana’s college education but need Ana to work. Mr. Guzman leaves the party, and Ana is shown with a forlorn but accepting look on her face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene1_1.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This expository scene lays the groundwork for many of the film&amp;rsquo;s recurring themes and topics—such as Ana getting body shamed by Carmen and Ana’s parents questioning the role of higher education in her life. A central point of tension within the movie is the generational and cultural discrepancy between first and second generation immigrants, with Ana representing a contemporary and progressive Chicana whereas Carmen represents an immigrant Chicana still grounded in tradition. Ana’s parents don’t want her to pursue higher education because they view it as contradictory to the collectivist family unit that is at the heart of many Latin American cultures. Indeed, “Latin American cultures with a collectivistic orientation emphasize the goals and interests of the group over those of individual members. A critical aspect of a collectivistic ideology is a strong concern for the fate and well-being of one’s kin, and family members within collectivistic cultures often are expected to support each other and assist in the maintenance of the household” (Guerrero 86). This explains why Carmen is so insistent that Ana stay and help with Estela’s business. Although Ana remains placid in this scene, she has not given up on her hopes of going to college. As viewers will see throughout the rest of the movie, Ana’s individualist attitude toward higher education will continue to embolden the rift between her and her mom in addition to challenging the notion of collectivism within the Latino family.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 2: Ahora le toca a ella</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Later in the evening after the graduation party, Ana’s mom and dad are shown discussing her college education privately in their bedroom. The dad is shown displaying open-mindedness to the idea of Ana going to college whereas Ana’s mom is obstinately against the idea. Carmen goes on a brief spiel in Spanish, saying [translated] “I can educate her. I can teach her to sew. I can teach her to raise her kids. Tend to her husband. They’re not going to teach her those things in college…It’s a question of principles. It’s just not fair. I’ve worked since I was 13 years old. Ana is 18 years old. It’s her turn now” (00:10:15-00:10:31).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene1_2.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scene is essential to understanding the gender roles and gendered expectations present within this particular Mexican-American family and within Latino families at-large. Sadly enough, women are often agents of patriarchy within Latino households. As Scholar Catherine Leen writes: “Carmen’s sole opposition to Ana’s plans underlines the fact that…the family matriarch can be more machista than any patriarch” (5). Additionally, when Carmen says “it’s just not fair,” the scene insinuates that Carmen is harboring resentment and jealousy toward Ana since she is being given opportunities she never had the opportunity of pursuing. When Carmen was growing up in Mexico, she likely did not have supportive male figures like Mr. Guzman who encouraged her to obtain an education. Although it’s wrong for her to control Ana’s life, Carmen’s acceptance and perpetuation of gender roles are reflections of patriarchal ideas and systems that are endemic to Latin America and serve to oppress women across generations. For these reasons, Carmen’s resentment toward Ana may also explain why she is always body shaming her. As one movie reviewer writes: “Part of [Carmen’s] impatience with Ana comes from a sense of competition, an element that Ms. Cardoso and the writers, Josefina Lopez and George LaVoo, don&amp;rsquo;t make overly explicit” (Mitchell).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 3: Ana’s first day in Estella’s factory</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_3/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this scene, Ana comes to work at Estella’s factory for the first time. Ana begins to admire one of Estella’s dresses, to which her mom remarks “You’ll never fit into that one. It’s a size 7” (00:13:31). Two workers in the factory, Norma and Panchita, enter and are introduced to Ana. Carmen makes a fat-shaming comment to Panchita, which is poorly received. In general, the atmosphere in the factory and between the workers is tense, hostile, and unfriendly. As they begin to work, Estella explains that they gets paid 18 dollars for each dress they assemble, although Norma explains that the dresses are then sold at Bloomingdale’s for 600 dollars, which provokes outrage in Ana (00:17:20).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later on, the workers begin to exchange &lt;em>chismes&lt;/em>, or gossip, with each other. In an act of “spilling tea,” Carmen shares that Dorado Ortiz, a local man, is in love with Rosalí, one of the employees at the factory. Carmen in this regard says, “he would love to fatten you up, but don’t get as fat as Ana” (00:18:23). Fed up with these comments, Ana runs out of the factory, and her mom chases her. Carmen cannot chase her for long, for she collapses with exhaustion. She bemoans to Ana that she’s too tired to do the factory work nowadays: her hands are arthritic and she’s losing her eyesight. Speaking to her in Spanish, Carmen says to Ana [translated]: “Are you ashamed to work with us? So much hard work. So much sacrifice. And all for what? For you two. You just think I’m a dog that’s only good for working” (00:20:16).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bunbobabe.github.io/imgs/scene2_1.png" alt="Example image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scene importantly comments on the economic exploitation of Latino immigrant workers, whose vulnerabilities lead them to take jobs in industries known for poor wages and working conditions. The textile industry is a prime example. Indeed, the atmosphere in Estela’s factory is highly reminiscent of the &lt;em>maquilas&lt;/em> of Mexico. The shocking disparity between the production and commercial value of Estela’s dresses further cements the idea that society considers Latino labor to be low-skill and cheap despite the fact that this labor is ultimately indispensable to corporate profitability and success. Limited class and financial mobility is a pervasive border, yet Ana shows resistance to the normalization of the devaluation of Latin labor in this scene and throughout the film. Scholar Juanita Heredia corroborates by writing:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>By situating the women’s labor force at Estela’s factory in the film, Cardoso critiques Latina women’s working conditions in the garment industry in relationship to globalization. Ana, at first considered an outsider, becomes aware of the economic inequalities that exist between the Latina seamstresses working for her sister Estela in the factory and the corporate world represented by Bloomingdale’s, which reflects a social and economic hierarchy within metropolitan Los Angeles (11).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Dually, this scene also showcases the divide between the first generation immigrant culture and second generation immigrant experience with Ana and Carmen’s exchange on the street. Carmen expresses her grievances at how much she works and dedicates to a family that looks down on the type of labor she does. Again, Carmen exemplifies the values of hard work, family-centrism, and sacrifice expected of older immigrant generations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scene 4: The San Antonio statue</title><link>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bunbobabe.github.io/post/post_4/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this scene, Carmen is shown hanging up a San Antonio statue for Ana. She reveals she also hung one up for Estela 11 years ago when she first turned 18. The statues are importantly shown hanging upside down. This brief snippet showcases the influences of Catholicism in Latin American culture and folklore. Saint Anthony of Padua is known as a miracle worker who helps people find things they’ve lost. When hung upside down, he is invoked to quell issues with love and romance and help people leave singlehood. In hanging these up, Carmen shows she is hoping her daughters get married soon. Despite both daughters still being quite young, Carmen’s preoccupation with their marital status speaks again to the prevalence of gender roles and expectations for women in Latino households. In these conservative traditions, marriage is considered the most important path for a woman, and therefore their value is inherently linked to how eligible they are for marriage—which draws on shallow notions of beauty and desirability.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
